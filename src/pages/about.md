Hey there, my name is Andrew Robbins. üëã

I'm a 34 year old Web Developer living in Austin, Tx with my amazing wife and son.

I've been a Web Developer for over 10 years. During that time, I've worked for ad agencies, small dev shops, and everything in between.

These days I work mostly with React and JavaScript.

For the last 5 years I've been running a SaaS company called <a href="https://wpshop.io" target="_blank">ShopWP</a>‚Äîa WordPress plugin allowing anyone to sell Shopify products on any WordPress site.

I've been involved in the crypto space, to varying degrees, since 2015 when I started mining Ethereum. I still remember The DAO‚Ñ¢Ô∏è days like it was yesterday.

Slashproof is the name I've created to represent my next chapter into Ethereum and Web3. I'm a firm believer that we need to embrace decentralization if we want to make the world a more peaceful, just, and prosperous place. ‚ú®
